# CMPG323-Project-2---31607500

## Introduction

CMPG323-Project-2 is the second project of the CMPG 323 course. The project focuses on API development, utilizing the skills taught during the course. An Azure database is used to store all relevant information, and security measures have been implemented to ensure the safety of the data.

## API Development

The project involves the development of an API that provides various endpoints to interact with the database. These endpoints allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the stored data. The API follows industry best practices and utilizes secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect the data.

## Planning

During the planning phase of the project, I encountered several concepts and topics that were initially unfamiliar to me. To overcome these challenges, I engaged in extensive research, utilizing resources such as Microsoft Learn and other relevant materials. This research deepened my understanding and allowed me to grasp the necessary concepts required to complete the project. Through this process, I have significantly expanded my knowledge and skills as a programmer.

## Future Improvements

Although the project is not currently at the desired level of completion, I have undertaken additional courses and furthered my knowledge in the topic. As time permits, I plan to make changes to the project, addressing any identified mistakes and implementing improvements based on the acquired knowledge. These improvements may include enhancing the functionality of the API, optimizing performance, and refining the security measures.
