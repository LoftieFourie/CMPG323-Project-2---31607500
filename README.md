# CMPG323-Project-2---31607500
Project 2 of CMPG 323
# API Devlopment
using the skills taught to us we developed an API as well as an azure database to store all relevent information.
Security was implemented to ensure the safety of the data

# Planning

going into this project there was alot I did not understand and also many new concepts I had to do further research on to be able complete this project. Thus I started with microsoft learn and and did more indepth research on topics I found harder to comprehend. This all furthered my knowladge a great deal and allowed me to advance my skills as a programmer. Although this project is not where I want it to be it has helped me alot in understanding the concepts behind API.

# Future
I have done several courses to develop my knowladge in this topic more after the final version was added, thus I will be making changes to the project and fixing many mistakes when the time allows it.
